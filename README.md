Let’s first understand what Spark streaming is.
It is the core Spark API’s extension that allows high-throughput, scalable, and fault-tolerant stream processing of data streams that are live. There are many sources of ingesting data such as Flume, ZeroMQ, Twitter, Kinesis, and Kafka.
Also, you can also process TCP sockets through the use of complex algorithms that are expressed using high-level functions such as join, reduce, map, and window. Once the data is processed, you can push it to databases, live dashboards, and file systems like S3 and HDFS. It is also possible to apply the graph processing and machine learning algorithms of Spark to data streams.
